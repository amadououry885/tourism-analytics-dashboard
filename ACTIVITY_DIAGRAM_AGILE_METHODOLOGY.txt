note right of "Sprint Planning"
  **Sprint Planning (4 hours max for 2-week sprint)**
  - Team commits to sprint goal
  - User stories broken into tasks
  - Each task estimated in hours
  - Capacity = Velocity from previous sprints
end note

note right of "Daily Standup"
  **Daily Standup (15 minutes)**
  - Same time, same place
  - Standing format (promotes brevity)
  - Impediment resolution offline
  - Keeps team aligned & focused
end note

note right of "Development"
  **Development Standards**
  - Code follows style guide
  - Unit test coverage > 80%
  - Peer review mandatory
  - No direct commits to main
end note

note right of "Sprint Retrospective"
  **Sprint Review & Demo (2 hours)**
  - Show working increment
  - Gather stakeholder feedback
  - Discuss acceptance criteria
  - Plan adjustments
end note

note right of "Sprint Review"
  **Sprint Retrospective (1.5 hours)**
  - What went well (keep doing)
  - What went poorly (improve)
  - Team velocity tracking
  - Process improvements
end note
